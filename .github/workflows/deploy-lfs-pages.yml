name: Deploy LFS File to GitHub Pages # A descriptive name for the workflow

on:
  # This section defines WHEN the workflow runs:
  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch (usually 'main' or 'master')
  push:
    branches: [ main ] # <-- IMPORTANT: Change 'main' if your default branch has a different name!

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab on GitHub

# Sets permissions needed for the workflow to deploy to Pages
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write

  # This job handles getting the code and preparing the site files
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Specifies the type of virtual machine to use

      # Step 1.1: Get your repository code
      - name: Checkout repository including LFS files
        uses: actions/checkout@v4 # Uses a pre-made Action to check out code
        with:
          lfs: true # <-- This is KEY: Tells the checkout step to download actual LFS file content

          # IMPORTANT: This tells the action WHICH folder contains your website files
          # If your PDF and any HTML files are just in the root, '.' is correct.
          # If your site builds into a folder (e.g., '_site', 'build', 'public'), change '.' to that folder name.
